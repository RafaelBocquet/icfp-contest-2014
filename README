 * The most important files are lib/Lib/HL.hs (typecheck and compile) and LM/lambdaman_source.hl (LambdaMan logic)
 * Ghosts are coded in the target language (extended with labels)
 * LambdaMan code is generated from a simple typed language, with Ints, product and sum types.
 * Code for binary search trees (set and map), quadtrees, and min binary heaps is generated from python files for several types.
 * I keep in state : set of all pill locations, a graph of the map, nearest Pill distance for each node of the graph, count of pill in each vertex, ...
 * Ghost avoidance is the main priority, next is nearby pill collection, last is minimizing nearest pill distance.
 * It will probably fail on the largest maps :(
